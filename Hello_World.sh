# This is my first try of the bash programming
# There are few points which I would like to point out
# the command on the top is called as sheband1 this command
# sheband1 instructs the operating system to run the bash from
# the path /bin/bash
#
# furthermore, the file we have created can be executed using the command
# ./Hello_World.sh
# however, we will see a warning related to permission, if we try the same
# In order to execute the given file, we can either do the same eithe by
# using the following, $- bash Hello_World.sh
# or by using the      $- sh   Hello_World.sh


#
# In order to execute the same with the normal command, ./Hello_World.sh
# we need to provide permissinos to the given file using the chmod
# I will go throuh it later on
# in order to provide the executible permission.


# execute the following command before running the script
# $- chmod +x Hello_World.sh


echo "Hello Aman this is the first try of bash"
